### üéØ Goals

The client should include the following features:

- Show book details, create a new book, edit an existing book, and delete a book.
- Add a ‚Äúgenre‚Äù field to the Book entity (with at least 3 genres) and display that information where relevant.
- Implement a new data structure to store purchases and show them in a new Profile page showing the total I have spent on books. You may add or edit new files to support the new domain entities and API methods. Which books a user buys are to be defined at your discretion.
  - Extra (optional): I should be able to see how much I have spent on books grouped by genre.
